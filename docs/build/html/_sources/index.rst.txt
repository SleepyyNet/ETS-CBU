ETS-CBU documentation
=====================

At present, the tool is under heavy development and should not be used as it may contain major bugs.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ETS-CBU is a tool designed to manage ETS2 controller layouts. It has the ability to swap two different sets of controller configs, backup controller configs into .zip files and synchronise layouts between profiles with the press of a button.

A guide to the basic functions of this script can be found in the quickstart section.

**Important notes**

Currently, this will not work with American Truck Simulator

Currently, the method of accessing the profiles is setup only for Windows 8 and 10. Support for Windows 7 is coming soon. Ish.
