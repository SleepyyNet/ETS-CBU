ETS-CBU documentation
=====================

At present, the tool is under heavy development and caution should be taken as it may contain bugs.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get ETS-CBU, goto www.github.com/codemicro/ets-cbu and download as a .zip file. Extract it anywhere you like (I would put it in a folder in your documents), and to run, simply run ets-sbu.py!

ETS-CBU is a tool designed to manage ETS2 controller layouts. It has the ability to swap two different sets of controller configs, backup controller configs into .zip files and synchronise layouts between profiles with the press of a button.

A guide to the basic functions of this script can be found in the quickstart section.

**Important notes**

Currently, this will not work with American Truck Simulator. This will come soon. Hang tight.
