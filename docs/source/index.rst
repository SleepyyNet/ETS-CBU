ETS-CBU is a tool designed to manage ETS2 controller layouts. It has the ability to swap two different sets of controller configs, backup controller configs into .zip files and synchronise layouts between profiles with the press of a button.

A guide to the basic functions of this script can be found in the quickstart section.

This be some text explaining something that could possibly be semi-important.:

	print("hello")
	>> hello
