Commands for swap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**swap init**

This command initiates the swap function by making all current controller layouts into .etcbu1 or .etcbu2 files. You then need to start ETS2 and open the profile you have been working with. Create controller layouts from in the game, and then you can use other functions normally. If you try to run this command when the profile has already been initiated for swapping, the script will complain. You only need to initialise a profile once, but you need to do it for every profile you want to use swap with.

Arguments

* \-c
   * This will make a copy of the control layout files and convert those into .etcbu files so you don't have to start all over again with your controller layouts.
