# ETS2 controller layout manager
**Known as ETS-CBU for short**,
this is a Python script that will create backups of controller layouts, synchronise controller layouts between profiles and swap between different layouts in the same profiles.

## Requirements
The requirements to run this project are:
  * Python 3 (written in Python 3.6.4)
  * Base libraries included with Python (the script uses _os_, _sys_, _time_ and _shutil_)
  * Euro Truck Simulator 2 (or atleast the folder it generates in your _Documents_ folder)
